## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM on AWS

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - AWS VPC with 2 subnets

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
FGTPublicIP = <FGT Public IP>
Password = <FGT Password>
Username = <FGT Username>
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
